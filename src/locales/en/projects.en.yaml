    target-audience: Children at special education schools
    description: |
      In our first project, we wanted to connect one that was disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: children with special education needs. We made custom musical performances for each occasion and managed to play for hundreds of children, in total.

      _This project was financially supported by the Prins Bernhard Cultuurmakersfonds._

      Being a student in this time of social isolation is difficult. In this project, we want to reach and connect those students, coming to their doorstep or school and playing custom-made performances for them.

      _This project is financially supported by the Fonds Podiumkunsten._

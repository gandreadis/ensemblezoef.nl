    title: Cultureel Zwerfgoed
    target-audience: Individuals in homeless shelters
    description: |
      The pilot project of the previous year was full of heartwarming and meaningful moments: _"Many of our residents are depressed and don't see many moments of joy, but you brought a lot of light and joy to our shelter"_ (coach at one of the shelters ZOEF visited). We would like to build on this and extend the project to even more people. With everything that we've learned from the pilot project, this new phase will be at bigger scale and hopefully reach even more and younger homeless individuals. In close collaboration with the Dutch shelter organization "Leger des Heils", we will visit 10 shelters across the Netherlands, starting in April 2024.

  cultural-wandering-heritage-pilot:
    title: Pilot Cultureel Zwerfgoed
    target-audience: Individuals in homeless shelters

      We channeled the untapped cultural talents of homeless individuals in this project, where we coached them in writing their own music. This pilot was a collaboration with Joris Branderhorst (also known as George Kush).

  around-the-lines:
    title: Rondom die Lijntjes
    target-audience: Patients in psychiatric clinics and in insitutions for the syndrome of Down
    description: |
      For persons with a mental handicap, music can be a powerful force for connection and inspiration. In this project in 2022, we hope to provide at least 10 performances for these persons, bringing our music and tailor-made performance to them. To make our performances accessible to the whole audience, we include them in the process by involving elements of drawing and improvisation.

  student-balkony:
    title: On Students' Doorsteps
    target-audience: Students (vocational and scientific education)
    description: |
      Being a student in this time of social isolation is difficult. In this project, we want to reach and connect those students, coming to their doorstep or school and playing custom-made performances for them.

      _This project is financially supported by the Fonds Podiumkunsten._

  nugter-masquerade:
    title: Masquerade - Collaboration with Chiel Nugter
    target-audience: Everybody
    description: |
      In this project, we collaborated with a young Dutch composer to make his dream a reality: recording a CD of his music with a classical ensemble. The album with music by Chiel Nugter can be found [on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4U2nGJ1NWcQz2RouA18wEV?si=bV_u8gJGRGO3cVJ1mtfjkg).

  energetic-breeze:
    title: An Energetic Breeze
    target-audience: Children at special education schools
    description: |
      In our first project, we wanted to connect one that was disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: children with special education needs. We made custom musical performances for each occasion and managed to play for hundreds of children, in total.

      _This project was financially supported by the Prins Bernhard Cultuurmakersfonds._

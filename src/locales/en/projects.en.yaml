  around-the-lines:
    title: Around the Lines (planned)
    target-audience: Patients in psychiatric clinics and in insitutions for the syndrome of Down

      For persons with a mental handicap, music can be a powerful force for connection and inspiration. In this project in 2022, we hope to provide at least 10 performances for these persons, bringing our music and tailor-made performance to them. To make our performances accessible to the whole audience, we include them in the process by involving elements of drawing and improvisation.

  student-balkony:
    title: On Students' Doorsteps
    target-audience: Students (vocational and scientific education)

      Being a student in this time of social isolation is difficult. In this project, we want to reach and connect those students, coming to their doorstep or school and playing custom-made performances for them.

      _This project is financially supported by the Fonds Podiumkunsten._

    title: Masquerade - Collaboration with Chiel Nugter
    target-audience: Everybody
    description: |
      In this project, we collaborated with a young Dutch composer to make his dream a reality: recording a CD of his music with a classical ensemble. The album with music by Chiel Nugter can be found [on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4U2nGJ1NWcQz2RouA18wEV?si=bV_u8gJGRGO3cVJ1mtfjkg).

  energetic-breeze:
    title: An Energetic Breeze
    target-audience: Children at special education schools
    description: |
      In our first project, we wanted to connect one that was disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: children with special education needs. We made custom musical performances for each occasion and managed to play for hundreds of children, in total.

      _This project was financially supported by the Prins Bernhard Cultuurmakersfonds._

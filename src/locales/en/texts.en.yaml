about:
  title: About us
  text: |
    ZOEF is a **creative**, **creating** collective. Every performance has its own character, transforming the location and context into a musical expierence. We try to push our environment and ourselves to move boundaries. Together with our audience, we explore different styles with arrangements tailored to our ensemble.

    This collective emerged from the mindset of the Ricciotti Ensemble. Here we gathered experiences with playing for many different audiences and learned how to make authentic connections through a broad and diverse repertoire. Starting from our base repertoire (incl. Bach, Britten, Faur√©, Piazzolla, Purcell, Vaughan Williams, and different arrangements of jazz, klezmer and folk music) we build an authentic performance for each location, inspired by our audience. By visiting and exploring our locations in advance, we often arrive at the topics that will determine our performance.
